GitHub is an online hub that allows its users to control/keep up with changes in code versions and work with others. git is a system that allows users to upload/retreive/edit from command prompt or similiar without needing to use the webbased platform
I am adding more information about branching in git. A branch is seperate from tha main and changes can be made here without affecting the main.
this is user 2 adding notes about pull request in github. pull request allow users to propose changes and the main author is then allowed to merge changes.
