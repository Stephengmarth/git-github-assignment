I had a lot of trouble at first. I’ve never worked with a command-line interface like this, nor have I ever used Command Prompt unless it was something I copied and pasted from the internet.
However, in the end, it all started to make sense. The biggest issue I faced was understanding the specific commands. For example, I had to look up "nano" to learn how to edit a document from the command-line interface.
I now understand the process: create the document, edit it, stage it, and then commit it. Once I saw what was generated on the GitHub website, everything began to come together. 
The highlighted lines of new text and the option to confirm or reject the changes made the tool’s purpose clearer. Git is a powerful tool for collaboration and version control.
